1.Project Introduction

The assignment is to complete the implementation of the Evaluator class which is responsible to calculate output of a given mathematical expression. The method eval() in this class takes String as input parameter, processes the mathematical expression and outputs an integer value. The operators in the mathematical expression follow the PEMDAS priority rule for calculations. The operator and operands of the expression are processed and saved in the Operator and Operand objects respectively. There are two stacks designed to hold the Operator's and Operand's. The priority of operators is saved in a static hashmap and cannot be altered. The super-class Operator is further sub classed by several operator sub-classes such as AdditionOperator, SubtractionOperator and so on. During processing, we pop the operator and operands, calculate their result and the result is pushed back to the operand stack. Two operands are popped for every operator. The process of popping from stack is performed until the stack is empty and the last result is returned from the eval() method.

2. Summary of Technical Work

The EvaluatorUI and EvaluatorTester classes take the mathematical expression input from the user. EvaluatorUI is a calculator GUI which extends the javax.swing.JFrame class. In this JFrame, we draw a java.awt.TextField to display the expression and a java.awt.Panel to show calculator buttons. We use the java.awt.Button for calculator buttons and each button is attached to an ActionListener with the EvaluatorUI class context. Due to the ActionListener, we receive the button clicks in actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0) method and the user input is processed in this method.

The EvaluatorTester class is the terminal version of accepting user input. It runs a for loop to keep accepting expressions from the terminal, evaluate the expression and display the result. From the terminal, expression must be entered in double quotation marks in order to avoid ambiguity. Such as "(3+4) * 2".

Evaluator class is the heart of this application and is responsible to process the mathematical expression and output its result. The public method eval(String input) in this class is called from EvaluatorUI and EvaluatorTester. This method takes the mathematical expression as the String datatype and returns solution as an integer datatype. The constructor of Evaluator class initializes the OperatorStack, OperandStack and a HashMap mapping the mathematical operators to its respective classes. First the eval() method separates operators and operands from the expression using StringTokenizer. The following delimiters are provided to StringTokenizer: "+-*^/#!() ". The separated operators and operands are inserted into their respective stacks and the stack-based expression evaluation algorithm is used to compute the result. The stack-based expression evaluation algorithm is described in the following paragraphs. 

The Operand class is used as an object for each operand identified in the mathematical expression. The operand class has two constructors to save the operand value in the object. First constructor takes the input as String datatype, converts to integer and saves as integer datatype. Second constructor takes input as integer datatype and saves as an integer. This class exposes two public methods to other classes. First is getValue() to expose the operand integer value from Operand object and second is check(String token)  to check if the String parameter is a valid operand.

The Operator class is an abstract class and holds the static HashMap to map different operator sub-classes to the mathematical operators. This class exposes one public method check(String token) to see if the token is a valid operator for our implementation. Other abstract methods such as priority() and execute(Operand op1, Operand op2) are implemented by respective operator sub-classes.

There are 8 operator subclasses namely: AdditionOperator, SubtractionOperator, MultiplicationOperator, DivisionOperator, PowerOperator, LeftParenthesesOperator, RightParenthesesOperator and InitOperator. All these classes extend the Operator class and @Override the two abstract methods from Operator. The InitOperator is used as a dummy operator in our implementation and is not a valid mathematical operator.

The operators are assigned priorities based on the PEMDAS rule (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations) as follows:

Operator	Priority
AdditionOperator, SubtractionOperator	2
MultiplicationOperator, DivisionOperator	3
PowerOperator	4
LeftParenthesisOperator, RightParenthesisOperator	1
InitOperator	-1

We use the following algorithm to evaluate the mathematical expression:

"	If an operand token is scanned, an Operand object is created from the token, and pushed to the operand Stack
"	If an operator token is scanned, and the operator Stack is empty, then an Operator object is created from the token, and pushed to the operator Stack
"	If an operator token is scanned, and the operator Stack is not empty, and the operator's precedence is greater than the precedence of the Operator at the top of the Stack, then and Operator object is created from the token, and pushed to the operator Stack
"	If the token is (, and Operator object is created from the token, and pushed to the operator Stack
"	If the token is ), the process Operators until the corresponding ( is encountered. Pop the ( Operator.
"	If none of the above cases apply, process an Operator.

Processing an Operator means to:
"	Pop the operand Stack twice (for each operand - note the order!!) 
"	Pop the operator Stack
"	Execute the Operator with the two Operands
"	Push the result onto the operand Stack

"	When all tokens are read, process Operators until the operator Stack is empty.






3. Execution and Development environment

The expression evaluator described above is coded in java language. Java is a programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. JVM is a computing machine which enables the computer to run a Java program. For compiling and execution, Java source code is compiled into bytecode when we use the javac compiler. The bytecode gets saved on the disk with the file extension .class. When the program is to be run, the bytecode is converted using the compiler. The result is machine code which is then fed to the memory and is executed. 

We use the following java development environment for our application.

9. Conclusion

The above implementation evaluates the mathematical expression within the scope of the requirements. Implementation has been tested on terminal as well as the java based graphical user interface. The assumptions and limitations of this implementation have been described in this document.

The code is written following the concepts of object-oriented programming system (OOPS) such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, etc. The project also involves interaction between Java Swing and Core Java.
